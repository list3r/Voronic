############################################# \
######## USER CONFIG OVERRIDES FILE #########  + --> This will help you personalize my config to your printer :)
############################################# /

# This file is yours! Feel free to edit it in order to include all the needed
# things to adapt my generic config to your machine. This file will not be erased
# when updating the config using moonraker and it will be kept as you've set it.
# You can change every section of the config. You can also add some new custom macros, etc...
# The corresponding documentation can be found in: docs > overrides.md

### Also, keep in mind: if you use a multi-MCU config such as the old school double SKRs or a CANbus toolhead
### board, you will need to specify which components are connected to which board in your own mcu.cfg file!
### Example: if something is connected to the toolhead MCU, you should use "config_pin: toolhead:PIN_NAME".

#> Main control MCUs are called "mcu" (and "secondary" when using a double MCU configuration)
#> Toolhead CANboard MCUs are called "toolhead"
#> MMU/ERCF MCUs are called "mmu"

#   START_PRINT SEQUENCE  #
#-------------------------#

## The START_PRINT sequence is modular and fully customizable. A default START_PRINT sequence is auto-populated based on
## your probe choice (TAP, Dockable, Inductive), but if for some reasons you still want to modify it, please uncomment the following 3
## lines to define a new `variable_startprint_actions`. You can use any number of action or even duplicate some actions if needed.
## Available actions: "bed_soak", "extruder_preheating", "chamber_soak", "extruder_heating", "tilt_calib", "z_offset", "bedmesh", "purge", "clean", "primeline"
##
# [gcode_macro _USER_VARIABLES]
# variable_startprint_actions: "action1", "action2", ...
# gcode: # do not remove this line


#-------------------------#
#   EXTRUDER/BED PIDs     #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the PIDs. I put them here as almost everyone will use them,
## so just uncomment the following lines and change the values according to your own machine
 [extruder]
 control: pid
 pid_kp: 19.882
 pid_ki: 1.052
 pid_kd: 93.945

 [heater_bed]
 control: pid
 pid_kp: 59.789
 pid_ki: 3.267
 pid_kd: 273.537


#-------------------------#
#   Z MOTORS DIRECTION    #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the motor directions as it's a pretty common one. If you need
## to invert the Z1 or Z3 motor direction on your machine, just uncomment the following lines.
[stepper_z1]
dir_pin: !Z1_DIR

[stepper_z3]
dir_pin: !Z3_DIR


#-------------------------#
#   Probe Offsets         #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for bed probes. These frequently have calibrated offsets for xyz,
## and many will need them during setup. If you need to set these, just uncomment the following lines.
# [probe]
# x_offset: -1.85
# y_offset: 29.3
# z_offset: 12.6

#-------------------------------#
#	cartographer stepper_z	#
#-------------------------------#

# Z Stepper overrides for Cartographer
[stepper_z]
endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop # use cartographer as virtual endstop
homing_retract_dist: 0 # cartographer needs this to be set to 0
position_max: 280
step_pin: PF11
dir_pin: PG3
enable_pin: !PG5
rotation_distance: 40
gear_ratio: 80:16
microsteps: 32
#endstop_pin: PG10
##  Z-position of nozzle (in mm) to z-endstop trigger point relative to print surface (Z0)
##  (+) value = endstop above Z0, (-) value = endstop below
##  Increasing position_endstop brings nozzle closer to the bed
##  After you run Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE, position_endstop will be stored at the very end of your config
position_endstop: 2.65
position_min: -10
homing_speed: 8
second_homing_speed: 3
homing_retract_dist: 3

[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: [your x-axis center coordinate], [your y-axis center coordinate]
# Example home_xy_position: 175,175 - This would be for a 350 * 350mm bed. 
z_hop: 10

#	Homing speed		 #
#--------------------------------#
[stepper_x]
rotation_distance: 40

position_min: 0
position_endstop: 300
position_max: 300
homing_speed: 50   #Max 100
homing_retract_dist: 5

[stepper_y]

full_steps_per_rotation:200  #set to 400 for 0.9 degree stepper
position_min: 0

homing_retract_dist: 5

[heater_bed]

sensor_type: Generic 3950

##  Adjust Max Power so your heater doesn't warp your bed. Rule of thumb is 0.4 watts / cm^2 .
max_power: 0.6
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 120
